								<h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>

								<p>Hi!, my name is David Pepin and I am enrolled in Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) and am in the third year of my degree. I am taking Intro to I.T. as an elective subject as I believe it will be useful for my further studies and career to have a base understanding of the I.T. world. My student number is s3604797, so therefore my student email is s3604797@student.rmit.edu.au. I completed high school in Melbourne’s west in 2015 and went straight into RMIT in 2016, only taking a semester off in 2017 to work at a summer camp in the United States and do some further travel in Europe. I personally enjoy listening to music, hanging out with mates and hockey, which I have just started playing. A fun fact about myself is that I love hiking and have completed the Kokoda Track in Papua New Guinea in 2013.</p>

<h2> Intrest in I.T. </h2>
		<p>I am studying Geospatial Science , which deals with the presentation of geographic data and involves a wide range of I.T. related fields such as data management, analysis and application of this data using mapping services.  I particularly am interested in the geodata analysis in the form of strategic planning and asset management. Geospatial Science relies a great deal on computer applications and data querying to gather necessary data and apply it in an effectively for customers or clients to use. I chose geospatial science originally because of my interest in Geography in high school and upon starting the course I learnt of the strong I.T. reliance the course had to unlock and create information and resources to do with geography. This largely drove my choice to choose Intro to I.T as a university elective. Outside of this I have a base interest in I.T. through application usage and through a wider scope, playing video games, using social media and keeping up with current events to do with I.T. I have some basic programming skills developed during my time at RMIT, mainly matlab and HTML, and have knowledge and experience using GIS (Geographic Information Services) products.
	</p>
	<p>I chose RMIT in 2015 largely because it was one of 2 universities in Australia at the time offering a Geospatial Science course. Other than this I had been given a good recommendation school staff, friends and a sibling who also studied at RMIT. It’s central location in Melbourne was also a bonus. </p>
	<p> During the rest of my studies, I hope to bolster my skills in GIS whilst also learning further programming and I.T. skills which will be useful when seeking a job when I graduate. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/jobad.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>This Job listing for a spatial information analyst for the City of Sydney. Further down the page the listing gives an further explanation. </p>
								<p> <i> “Working as part of a team of GIS professionals you will be involved in planning and delivering initiatives that optimise the City’s capability in and use of spatial information. You will analyse complex datasets to deliver high quality map products, provide advice and support on effective use of spatial data/information/technologies, and work collaboratively with team members.” </i> </p>
								<p> This job would require primarily, strong skills of being able to manipulate and extract spatial data and being able to present geographic resources that would bolster efficiency of the organisation and the City of Sydney itself. Within the GIS industry, knowledge of Esri products such as ArcGis and Geomedia are key as they are widely used and people with these skills are sought after. Basic I.T. skills would also play a key role and tie into this. Outside of this, interpersonal and teamwork skills would be needed, especially due to the listing has an apparent collaborative aspect due to working as a part of a team to meet and deliver goals and projects.  </p>
								<p> Ideally, I am interested in working for local government councils or government bodies upon completing my degree. This particularly interests due to the strategic planning aspects of the job and delivering effective mapping products whereas private GIS companies I have found, tend to focus on asset management and workflow efficiency. The job listing above would require a good amount of experience before being able to meet the requirements for this job, however upon looking for a job listing online it seems there is a strong demand for GIS professionals. Whilst the job is in Sydney, I am not opposed to moving from Melbourne in order to gain employment and would love international opportunities. The social, team environment is also one that I would prefer over a purely individual work. Working within government organisations also usually entails guidelines and knowledge of legislation, which I believe would be key in this particular job. </p>
								<p>Through my studies at RMIT and its work experience requirement, I have a good theoretical knowledge of Esri GIS products which are widely used in the industry and appear as required knowledge in a large majority of the job listings I discovered online. Through work experience I have had the chance to engage in some real-life projects, however I believe I would have to back this up with further experience through perhaps a graduate position. I believe I posses strong interpersonal skills that would be beneficial in team environments which is generally how I have found GIS professionals work within various organisations. This has been developed through RMIT group work, extra curricular sports and customer based interactions from my part – time retail job. </p>
								<p> To gain the level of experience needed to apply for this job, I believe I would have to be in the industry and have around 5+ years experience in various organisations. This would mean I could rely on my I.T., program usage and problem solving ability in a range of settings to deliver high importance products to an organisation. To do this I will try to establish a range of work experience to meet the requirement for my course (8 weeks to graduate) which I have found very rewarding. Upon graduating at the end of 2020, I will try to apply for a graduate position or a local council GIS analyst to gain employment. From there perhaps I will broaden my skills, and perhaps specialise in a part of the GIS industry such as strategic planning, remote sensing or cartography. </p>

								<h3> Myers Briggs Test </h3>
								<p> The Myers - Briggs personality test which sorts individuals into a range of 16 personality types, delivered the result of ESFJ ('The Consul'). The image above shows my results. </p>
								<p> <i> Results and image were sourced from <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/"> https://www.16personalities.com/ </i> </a>
								<h3> Learning Style Test </h3>
								<p> The learning style test delivered the result of:
								<ul> <li> 35% Auditory </li>
								<li> 35% Visual </li>
								<li> 30% Tactile</li>
								<i> Results sourced from <a href=" http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" </a> http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml </i> </p>
								<h3> Creativity Test  </h3>
								<p> I received a creativity score of 51.67%, according to the website used, I am below the average of 63% </p>
								 <p> <i> Results were sourced from <a href = "http://www.testmycreativity.com/" </a> http://www.testmycreativity.com/</i> </p>

								<p>  The results of the three tests highlight different things for me. The Myers – Briggs test seemed to be oddly familiar in the way it explained my personality type however there were some things I disagreed with. For example, in the introduction for ‘The Consul’ personality type it states <i>‘Consuls are the cheerleaders and the quarterbacks, setting the tone, taking the spotlight and leading their teams forward to victory and fame.’ </i> Which is somewhat distant to how I think of myself in team and leadership situations. In other ways, the personality test was interesting in stating my personality is conflict-averse <i>‘Consuls are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones’</i> which I believe to be more accurate. The learning type was somewhat balanced which I believe to be true in term of the way I gather information. Furthermore, I find I do not favour one type of learning above others and appreciate an approach that incorporates all three learning styles when learning. Finally, the creativity test highlighted that I had a below average creativity score. I agree with this as I don’t see myself as the most creative person and don’t usually engage in creative activities. In terms of my degree, whilst there is creative elements in terms of cartography, it is largely data based which is not typically artful.</p>
								<p> After reading ‘The Consul’ explanation after completing the test, it suggests that I favour groupwork above individual work. The explanation states ‘ Consuls are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure’ and ‘Good listeners and enthusiastic team members´ These traits are obviously positive in terms of working as a team and point towards a being a dependable member of a group task. In the early stages of group work especially, being enthusiastic and listening to group ideas and concerns are key. These behaviours are key in building team interest and ensuring each member is heard when building a plan to deliver the final product. After initial discussion, implementation of the plan will mean being supportive of other group members whilst being dependable and finishing the tasks outlined for myself. Creativity is not a strong suit, so perhaps allowing others in the group take charge of those tasks would be in the interest of the group. I could offer support, but generating ideas that showcase creativity would be best left to others whilst I handle more clear – cut tasks.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Idea</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/personality.JPG" alt="" /></span>

								<p> My idea is to design a phone application called “Get Sport” that focuses on finding teammates or pre existing teams to join within your local area. The app is designed to find sporting teams with your level of capability. The app will based around how far/ what distance users input for their maximum to travel to both training and home and away games  The application could also be used by clubs and teams to advertise for individuals to join their teams, club events or teams who just need a fill – in. Users can tailor their experience to filter particular sports in or out and are kept up – to – date with happenings in the area around them. </p>
								<p>In Australia, obesity is a rampant issue, with nearly two – thirds (63%) of adults recorded as overweight or obese. (AIHW, 2016) This issue is coupled with low levels of exercise with 65.3% of Australians over 15 years old having low levels of exercise. This app could aim to tackle this issue as people are made aware of sporting and exercise options in their local area. This could therefore encourage ongoing exercise routines (E.g. training each week) which, in turn, could improve the health of many Australians. Local clubs & businesses would also see an added benefit of greater involvement from the community. </p>
								<p> On the user side of the application, individuals will make a profile of themselves and input some Information such as age, previous experience, skill level, sport interests, address, maximum distances to travel, etc. to tailor the results. If they join a team or exercise group, users will be provided with information about upcoming events such as training sessions, fixtures, ladders and various social happenings associated with their team, all of which is kept updated by the club itself. The app will have a strong mapping aspect which will show the location of sporting grounds or facilities. For users searching for new teams, icons above sporting grounds will identify clubs, teams or groups that use the facility. The aim to provide users with as much information as possible to encourage them to participate in any sort of exercise occurring in their local area. </p>
								<p> Not being of an I.T. background, I am not overly sure about the tools and technologies that would be needed. Tools such as MIT App Inventor could be useful in designing the layout and different components of the application .If the idea was pivoted to be a website, HTML would be of key importance in addition to other programming languages. GeoJSON, which I have had some previous experience with, could also be useful for the mapping and API uses of the map. </p>
								<p>The set of skills required would rest heavily on the programming of application. Knowledge of app construction and programming languages is likely key to this large scale project. Due to this, it would be highly unfeasible to gather the full skills and software for this idea. However, I believe a base prototype or app layout could be constructed for this project.</p>
								<p> Should this project be successful, it could be an incredibly useful tool for community interaction and outreach. The app would aim to raise the activity levels of all Australians and give the encouragement needed for many people to join local teams or clubs which they previously may not have known about. </p>
